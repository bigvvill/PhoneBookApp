# PhoneBookApp

This is an application where you should record contacts with their phone numbers.
Users should be able to Add, Delete, Update and Read from a database, using the console.
You need to use Entity Framework, raw SQL isn't allowed.
Your code should contain a base Contact class with {Id INT, Name STRING and Phone Number(STRING)}
You should use Code-First Approach, which means EF will create the database for you.
You should use SQL Server, not SQLite
